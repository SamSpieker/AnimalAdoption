                        Animal adoption is a noble act of taking care of lost or abandoned animals,
                        such as cats and dogs, who cannot fend for themselves. These animals are usually
                        picked up by animal control authorities and taken to animal shelters where they
                        can receive proper care. To make animal adoption easier and more convenient,
                        our web-based adoption site features comprehensive information about the animals available for adoption.
